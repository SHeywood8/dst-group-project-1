    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this group project, we are tasked with exploring a binary classification problem or a regression problem. The project focuses on developing and comparing different models, with each group member contributing their own model submission. The models will be evaluated on left-out test data. A key aspect of our work will be to select, test, and agree upon a performance metric to assess these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is not only to build effective models but to critically evaluate their performance in real-world scenarios. This will involve exploring various methods, including standard and advanced regression or classification techniques, and investigating the appropriateness of our chosen performance metrics. By using left-out test data, we aim to test whether our models generalize well to new data. At the end, we will have a comparison of the methods. We will highlight which approach performs best based on the agreed metric and we will reflect on the limitations and strengths of each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, collaboration and learning from each other’s expertise will be vital. We will build upon what we have learnt in Project 0, taking into consideration the issues we faced and the things which worked well. We aim to deepen our understanding of model evaluation while applying data science techniques to real-world problems."

    "# Link to Project 0\n",
    "In Project 0, we learned about the different types of datasets and explored several application domains. We also found several data sources. In this section, we provide links to Project 0, and summarise the relevant research done there. Establishing this as context, we explain how this will guide us in Project 1, with details on how we have chosen our classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is extremely important in various industries as it supports informed decision-making, pattern recognition, and forecasting. The wide range of applications lead to a wide variety of datasets. In Project 0, we found that datasets could be categorised as structured, unstructured or hybrid datasets (though this categorisation was not uniform across the literature and online resources -- see references [1], [2], and [3]). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Project 0, we decided to use a structured dataset, as they are easy to find. Having decided on the dataset type, we then chose an application domain. We saw that there were many application domains, including but not limited to healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education and e-commerce. In Project 0, we chose the finance application domain as finance data was abundant and highly varied. This made it easy to find finance data, and provided opportunities to apply many different techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "In trying to find finance data, we stumbled upon many data sources. These are described in the next subsection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Several repositories and databases offer access to a wealth of datasets for analysis. We give a list below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**: A popular platform for data science competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)**: A repository of datasets which can be used for classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Monash Time Series Forecasting Repository](https://forecastingdata.org/)**: A repository for time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)**: A powerful tool for finding datasets across various domains, including finance. This search engine aggregates datasets from multiple sources, including academic institutions, government agencies, and commercial platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)**: Offers real-time and historical data on stocks, bonds, and commodities, as well as financial news and economic indicators, commonly used in market analysis. Data can be accessed freely through its API (application interface) -- see for example the package `quantmod` in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)**: A data platform that provides access to financial datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use Kaggle and the Yahoo Finance API. From Kaggle, we chose to analyse the Credit Card Fraud dataset, and from the Yahoo Finance API, we analysed Apple stock data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflections on Project 0\n",
    "The Apple stock data was interesting as it had several stylistic features which were interesting to uncover and understand. We noted that the modelling process was complicated, with the fitting process using quasi-likelihoods. For this reason, we decided not to pursue this dataset, or similar datasets, in Project 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the Credit Card Fraud dataset provided an interesting challenge since the data was unbalanced. We agreed that this data was interesting, so we decided to analyse a similar dataset for Project 1. We chose not to analyse the same data, as we wanted to showcase our abilities to draw unique insights when the answers were not presented to us. We believe that this self-imposed challenge will also help us grow and develop our skills further.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encountered an issue with the Kaggle dataset, as it was too large to upload to Github, and we did not have any other file hosting solution. We will be considering this issue in our data search for Project 1, and attempt to find a solution."

    "# Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project 0, we searched a variety of data sources to find datasets for Project 1. I found several interesting datasets that present unique challenges like imbalanced data, missing values, and outliers, making them excellent candidates for providing learning opportunities.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some sources, like large datasets or those requiring advanced techniques (e.g., NLP), were not pursued further due to size or complexity. Additionally, after experiencing hosting issues with the Credit Card Fraud dataset for Project 0, we decided to exclude large datasets for practical reasons. We will continue to explore methods to overcome file hosting problems throughout the project. Hence, we will still provide a list of large datasets below, but we may not use them for analysis unless we resolve file hosting issues.\n",
