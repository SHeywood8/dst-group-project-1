    "In this group project, we explore a classification problem involving income data. The project will involve exploring several models, such as decision trees, *ADD MORE AS PEOPLE CHOOSE THEIR MODELS*. The model performance will be assessed on left-out test data, chosen to answer a particular scientific question. We then explore several performance metrics, such as ROC curves, accuracy, precision and recall. We then select, test, and agree upon a performance metric to assess the models. The performance metric will be chosen such that it will lead to real-world generalisability. We will then compare the models with the chosen performance metric and reflect on the limitations and strengths of each method.\n",
