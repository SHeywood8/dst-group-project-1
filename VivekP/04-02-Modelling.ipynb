    "# About Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Little and Rubin give the following three types of missingness in [Chapter 3.1, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing completely at random (MCAR): Missingness is independent of any observed or unobserved variables. One example is when we cannot collect data on a patient in a hospital because a measuring instrument is accidentally broken. Some data would then be missing, and this would be independent of the observed or unobserved characteristics of the patient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing at random (MAR): Missingness depends on the observed data but not on the missing data.  Vateekul (see \\cite{vateekul2009tree}) gives an example in that `respondents with lower education may be less likely to complete the entire survey'. The cause of missingness is not due to the missing variable, but due to some other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-ignorable missingness: This is missing data that is neither MAR nor MCAR. In other words, the value of a missing variable is related to the reason of its missingness. For example, some people may wish to not report their income in a survey due to their income itself.\n",
    "\\end{enumerate}\n",
    "\n",
    "From our EDA, we concluded that the missingness was not MCAR, and is likely related to the income. To contend with the missing data, we will use the following strategies:\n",
    "- Surrogate splits\n",
    "- Treating missingness as its own category\n",
    "- Imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# About Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is imbalanced, accuracy can become a misleading measure of performance, since predicting everything as the majority class can give good accuracy. We will look at metrics of performance that can be used with imbalanced data and look at a method called SMOTE to try to tackle imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explain each of these strategies as we use them in the modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we look at classification trees, and explore these methods of dealing with missingness and imbalance."
