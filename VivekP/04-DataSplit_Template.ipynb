    "After doing EDA on the data, we saw that there were about twice as many males as females and that majority race was white. This prompted us to think about these questions:\n",
    "- How does the proportion of high income individuals vary across sex?\n",
    "- How does the proportion of high income individuals vary across race?\n",
    "\n",
    "AAt an in-person group meeting, we decided to focus on the first question. The `race` variable contained categories with very few observations in them, which would pose a challenge upon doing a test/train split. Hence, we will perform a test/train split, taking care to ensure that the distribution of the **sexes** in the test data is the same as in the overall data."
